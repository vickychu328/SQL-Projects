**Country Club Database Case Study**

Welcome to this SQL case study! In this repository, you'll find a project that explores a database containing information about a country club. The project involves working with MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, Jupyter Notebook, and SQLite to query and analyze data, similar to real-world tasks performed by data scientists and analysts.

## **Project Overview**
- Connect to a local SQLite database using Python.
- Explore the database structure in PHPMyAdmin.
- Retrieve and analyze data using SQL queries.
- Gain hands-on experience with database management tools.

## **Technology Stack**
- **SQLite**: Local database management.
- **Python**: For executing SQL queries and analyzing data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive Python environment.
- **PHPMyAdmin**: Graphical interface for database exploration.

## **Repository Contents**
- `sqlite_db_pythonsqlite.db`: SQLite database file.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook to connect to the database and query the `FACILITIES` table.
- `SQLTasks.sql`: Contains SQL queries for analysis.
- `README.md`: This documentation.
